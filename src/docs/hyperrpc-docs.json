Implementing a unique logic, it adds an extra layer of vulnerability for bots. The token includes a mapping called \\_buyBlock that stores the block number when a buy transaction occurs. During token transfers, the \\_beforeTokenTransfer function is triggered, and it checks if the from address has the same block number stored in \\_buyBlock. If it does, the transfer is flagged as a \"Bad bot!\" and blocked. The checkBot variable can be toggled by the contract owner to enable or disable the bot-checking functionality. Overall, this Antibot ERC20 token aims to deter and trap frontrunner bots by utilizing block number comparisons. This contract is inspired by an Ethereum Stackexchange discussion linked below.\nhttps://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/116857/stop-frontrunner-bots-by-comparing-block-number-of-buy-tx-versus-sell-and-transf\n\nOpen\n\nMoonbirds NFT\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1595478138716184577/g620V8sF_400x400.jpg)Moonbirds\n\n570\n\nA collection of 10,000 utility-enabled PFPs that feature a richly diverse and unique pool of rarity-powered traits.\n\nOpen\n\nERC721A\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1626300152746217472/b5KdCxM__400x400.jpg)Chiru-Labs\n\n567\n\nThis smart contract is an implementation of the ERC721A standard. It allows for the creation, ownership, and transfer of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The contract keeps track of token ownership, token metadata, and token counts. It also includes functions for minting, burning, and querying token information.\n\nOpen\n\nSimple ERC721 NFT Sale\n\nSCookbook\n\n516\n\nERC721 NFT with the following features: - Built-in sale with an adjustable price. - Reserve function for the owner to mint free NFTs. - Fixed maximum supply.\n\nOpen\n\nRoyalty Splitter\n\nROpenZeppelin\n\n475\n\nThis contract allows payments to be split among a group of accounts. The split can be in equal parts or set in percentages. The way this is specified is by assigning each account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set when you deploy the contract and can't be updated afterwards. Payments must be claimed from the contract by each user. NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you to run tests before sending real value to this contract.\n\nOpen\n\nAudited\n\nERC1155 with burnable NFTs and pausable transfers\n\nECookbook\n\n438\n\nERC 1155 NFT, the basic standard multi-token, with the following features: - Burn feature that allow users to burn their NFTs.
